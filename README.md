## Space Wars

This is a simple game developed for RxJS studies. It's based on the 3rd chapter from 'Reactive Programming with RxJS', but implemented with TypeScript using an Object Oriented approach. 

So, you ask: **Why use TypeScript and Object Oriented approach with RxJS?** I'm not crazy. The motivation for this reading and study is understanding and use better the RxJS integration with Angular 2, which uses this stack ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

### How to try

```bash
cd <your_worksspace>
git clone https://github.com/welingtonveiga/spacewars
cd clonewars
npm install webpack -g
npm install webpack-dev-server -g
npm install
npm run server
```
Then just go to [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/), and have funny :)


### Next Steps
* Study how to test with RxJS
* Add levels
* Add new enemies types with distinct behaviour
* Increment game challenge through levels
